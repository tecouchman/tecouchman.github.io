          <!--Having recently moved to China, I am currently looking for a position in IT. 
            In my previous role, working in a small team of software developers, I gained experience 
            of each step of the software development process, as well as the communication skills 
            required to work in such an environment. Through my degree I have developed a high level 
            of cultural awareness and understanding, and have also gained knowledge of the Chinese 
            business environment.-->
